# HTMLProject

This repository is collection of HTML, CSS and CGI scripts that I have created as part of a collaborative programming project for Biocomputing II during my MSc Bioinformatics at Birkbeck University. The project involved the creation of a web-based bioinformatics tool to analyse the sequence of chromosome 3, and the main goal was to provide a resource for understanding the molecular basis of human variation and disease.
